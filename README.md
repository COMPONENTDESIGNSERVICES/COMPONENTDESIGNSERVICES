- 👋 Hi, I’m @COMPONENTDESIGNSERVICES
- 👀 I’m interested in HAND WATERPUMP DESIGNS FOR BOREHOLES AND GROUNDWATER PUMPING.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DIFFERENT PUMP DESIGNS AND CONSIDERING CONSTRUCTION METHODS THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED. IDENTIFYING ALREADY AVAILABLE LOW COST COMPONENTS THAT MADE BE USED DIRECTLY OR MODIFIED EASILY. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DESIGNS AND CONCEPTS THAT REQUIRE MINIMUM PRODUCT COST, MAINTAINACE AND REPAIR ISSUES TO THE USER. 
- 📫 How to reach me OWPDP@COMPONENTDESIGNSERVICES.COM
